# What can I do with this plugins source code?
You can use this for:

    Commercial use ( Use in public servers, idk if credit is needed or not, its just a license off of choosealicense.com )
    Distribution ( Give others downloads to this plugin or any other forks )
    Modification ( Modify the plugin, whether it contributing to the main repo or to a fork )
    Patent use ( I dont know this one... )
    Private use ( Modify this code and use it for you're own server, e.g. customizing the plugin and using the customized code for you're server, without having to release it to the public, which means you're own private fork, that can't be shared online without source code )

You must:

    
    Disclose the source code of said fork, e.g. you're fork MUST be open source
    License and copyright notice, e.g. you're fork MUST include a link to this project
    Same license, e.g. you MUST use the same license we use ( GNU General Public License v3.0 )
    State changes, e.g. you MUST say what you changed
